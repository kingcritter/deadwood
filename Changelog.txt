Wednesday, May 24th 2017

added getTotalDays() to GameBoard
added getRehearseBonus() to Player

fixed taking roles: previously, there was no check on whether
a player was a high enough rank to take the role. Fixed by
adding check in Player.takeRole()

fixed onCard attribute of roles: previously, the DataReader 
class was hardcoded to call the Role constructor with "false"
for the onCard attribute. Fixed by changing DataReader.getRoles()
to accept a boolean onCard argument.

fixed Scene class so wrapScene is actually called: previously, 
decrementShotCounter() would only decrement the shot counter. 
Fixed by adding a check to see if the count drops to zero, in
which case wrapScene() is called.
