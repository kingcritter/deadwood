Updated DataReader to read in positioning information for board
game elements, i.e. rolls (both on card and off), cards in the 
scenes, and shot counters.

This required a few things: firstly, I created a nested public
class in Room called Area. So when you need a room object, the
type name is Room.Area. This has the atributes x, y, h, and w.
Note that they're marked with the final keyword, so when you are
working with a Room.Area object you can just access the atributes
directly, rather than using a getX(), getY(), etc.

Secondly (and thirdly, and fourthly) I added Area references
to the following classes: 
    * Role
        - in off-card roles, the position is relative to the 
        gameboard. In on-card roles, it's relative to the card.
        Accessible via getArea().
    * Room
        - in the Casting Office and Trailer, this is the area of 
        the whole room. In Scenes, this is the area of the card.
        Accessible via getArea(). 
    * Scene 
        - There is a HashMap that maps the take number (an Integer)
        to the area for that take. Accessible via getTakesArea().

added getTotalDays() to GameBoard
added getRehearseBonus() to Player

fixed taking roles: previously, there was no check on whether
a player was a high enough rank to take the role. Fixed by
adding check in Player.takeRole()

fixed onCard attribute of roles: previously, the DataReader 
class was hardcoded to call the Role constructor with "false"
for the onCard attribute. Fixed by changing DataReader.getRoles()
to accept a boolean onCard argument.

fixed Scene class so wrapScene is actually called: previously, 
decrementShotCounter() would only decrement the shot counter. 
Fixed by adding a check to see if the count drops to zero, in
which case wrapScene() is called.
